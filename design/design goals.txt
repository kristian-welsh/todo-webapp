design goals
============

Ablity to change deployment technologies in a config file to swap out implementations to make migrating databases or webapp framework a configuration issue.

Application function is visible from the domain structure, you should look at the top level directory structure and think "this is a todo aplication" not "this is a node webapp"

Structure is flexible to change in the right areas, with each module in the system dependent on modules more stable than itself.
