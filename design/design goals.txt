design goals
============

Ablity to change deployment technologies in a config file to swap out implementations to make migrating databases or webapp framework a configuration issue.

Application function is visible from the domain structure, you should look at the top level directory structure and think "this is a todo aplication" not "this is a node webapp"

Structure is flexible to change in the right areas, with each module in the system dependent on modules more stable than itself.

State in the system is kept to a bare minimum, the most important functionality shall be implemnted functionally.

Conditionals are limited to performing dependancy injection following the dependancy inversion principle.
